## What is Pixie?

Pixie is an open source observability tool for Kubernetes applications. Use Pixie to:

* Monitor your network ([tutorial](https://docs.px.dev/tutorials/pixie-101/network-monitoring))
* Inspect the health of your infrastructure ([tutorial](https://docs.px.dev/tutorials/pixie-101/infra-health))
* See service maps and service LET metrics ([tutorial](https://docs.px.dev/tutorials/pixie-101/service-performance))
* View individual full-body application requests ([tutorial](https://docs.px.dev/tutorials/pixie-101/request-tracing))
* Continuously profile your applications ([tutorial](https://docs.px.dev/tutorials/pixie-101/profiler))

Pixie's main features include:

* **Auto-telemetry**: [Pixie uses eBPF](https://docs.px.dev/about-pixie/pixie-ebpf/) automatically collect telemetry data.

* **In-cluster edge compute**: Pixie stores and queries all telemetry data locally in your cluster.

* **Scriptability**: Pixie’s flexible query language, can be used across Pixie’s UI, CLI, and client APIs. Pixie provides a set of [community scripts](https://github.com/pixie-io/pixie/tree/main/src/pxl_scripts) for common use cases.
