## What is Pixie?

Pixie is an open source observability tool for Kubernetes applications. Pixie uses [eBPF](https://docs.px.dev/about-pixie/pixie-ebpf/) to automatically capture telemetry data without the need for manual instrumentation.

Developers can use Pixie to view the high-level state of their cluster (service maps, cluster resources, application traffic) and also drill-down into more detailed views (pod state, flame graphs, individual full body application requests).

Pixie's main features include:

* **Auto-telemetry**: Pixie uses eBPF to automatically collect telemetry data such as full-body requests, resource and network metrics, application profiles, and [more](https://docs.px.dev/about-pixie/data-sources).

* **In-cluster edge compute**: Pixie collects, stores and queries all telemetry data locally in the cluster. Pixie uses less than 5% of cluster CPU, and in most cases less than 2%.

* **Scriptability**: [PxL](https://docs.px.dev/reference/pxl/), Pixie’s flexible Pythonic query language, can be used across Pixie’s UI, CLI, and client APIs. Pixie provides a set of [community scripts](https://github.com/pixie-io/pixie/tree/main/src/pxl_scripts) for [common use cases](https://docs.px.dev/tutorials/pixie-101).
